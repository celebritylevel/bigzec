## The 7 Viral Hook Types

Every post must open with one of these proven hook patterns. The first line is the most important line in the entire post — it determines whether people click "see more."

### Hook Type 1: The Obituary

Format: `RIP [Old Thing].`

Opens with a bold death declaration for an old way of doing things. Implies the reader is behind if they're still doing it.

Examples:
- RIP Lead Generation.
- RIP to basic Meta ad copy.
- RIP Google Slides.
- RIP Media Buyers.

When to use: When introducing an AI tool or workflow that replaces a manual process.

### Hook Type 2: The Builder

Format: `I built [specific thing] for [specific outcome].`

Positions the author as a maker/creator. The specificity is what makes it work.

Examples:
- I built THE ULTIMATE CLAUDE AI AGENT TEAM.
- I built 35 AI Workflows for Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO).
- I built 40 AI workflows for LinkedIn.

When to use: When showcasing a system, framework, or collection of tools you created.

### Hook Type 3: The Result

Format: `I [achieved specific result] in [timeframe].`

Leads with a concrete outcome. Numbers are mandatory.

Examples:
- I just replaced $10K/month in consultant fees with Relevance AI + Claude.
- I helped 3 Video Creative Agencies scale from $40K/mo to $100K-200K.
- I set up an acquisition system that generated $30K in the last 7 days.

When to use: When sharing case studies, personal results, or client outcomes.

### Hook Type 4: The Giveaway

Format: `Giving away [specific valuable thing]. For FREE.`

Immediately establishes value. The "for FREE" part creates a pattern interrupt because the item has implied high value.

Examples:
- Giving away EVERYTHING I used to grow to 2.5K followers on LinkedIn.
- I'm Giving Away 70 High-Quality Sales & Marketing AI Workflows. For FREE.
- Here's how I automated my ad creation (and I'm sharing it for free).

When to use: When distributing free resources, templates, or frameworks.

### Hook Type 5: The Value Comparison

Format: `[Industry players] charge $X for [thing]. I'm giving it away.`

Creates tension between what others charge and what you're offering. Makes the reader feel like they'd be foolish not to engage.

Examples:
- Agencies charge $3K-$5K for a creative strategy brief — but a Claude skill does it in 3 minutes.

When to use: When offering something for free that normally costs money, or when demonstrating AI cost savings.

### Hook Type 6: The Tool Drop

Format: `[Tool/AI] just [did something incredible].`

Announces a new tool or capability with urgency. Implies the reader needs to pay attention NOW.

Examples:
- CLAUDE COWORK just destroyed LinkedIn outreach.
- Claude Opus 4.6 just dropped. I tested it for Meta ads.
- SONNET 4.6 now handles my LinkedIn outreach.

When to use: When reacting to new AI releases, tool updates, or sharing a new discovery.

### Hook Type 7: The Story

Format: `[Person] [did thing] [timeframe ago]...`

Opens with a mini-narrative. Creates curiosity — the reader wants to know what happened next.

Examples:
- A friend who runs an agency called me yesterday.
- One of my clients asked me to test something wild...

When to use: For case studies, client stories, or personal revelations. Best for building emotional connection.

## Post Body Structure

After the hook, every post follows one of these body frameworks.

### Framework A: Problem-Agitate-Solve (Most Common)

```
[HOOK - 1 line]

[Empty line]

[Problem statement - 1-2 short lines about old/broken way]

[Agitate - 1-2 lines amplifying the pain or cost]

[Empty line]

[Solution introduction - 1 line]

[Empty line]

[What it does - bullet list, 4-8 items]
- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2
- Bullet 3

[Empty line]

[Results/Proof - specific numbers]

[Empty line]

[CTA block]
```

### Framework B: The List Drop

```
[HOOK - 1 line]

[Empty line]

[1-2 lines of context about what you're sharing]

[Empty line]

[Numbered or bulleted list of items - the core value]
1. Item one
2. Item two
3. Item three
...

[Empty line]

[CTA block]
```

### Framework C: Story-to-System

```
[HOOK - story opener]

[Empty line]

[Story beats - 3-5 short lines, one per line]

[Empty line]

[The revelation/insight - 1-2 lines]

[Empty line]

[The system/solution - bullet list]

[Empty line]

[Results - specific numbers]

[Empty line]

[CTA block]
```

## Formatting Rules (Critical)

These formatting rules are non-negotiable. They are what make the posts scannable and high-performing on LinkedIn/X.

### Whitespace

- **One idea per line.** Never write multi-sentence paragraphs.
- **Blank line between every thought.** Double line breaks are the standard.
- **Short sentences.** 5-15 words per line is the sweet spot.
- **Never write a wall of text.** If you see 3+ sentences in a row without a line break, reformat.

### Bullet Points & Lists

- Use simple dashes (`-`) or numbers for lists
- Keep each bullet to one line (max two)
- 4-8 bullets is the sweet spot (enough value, not overwhelming)
- Emoji bullets are acceptable but not required (use sparingly)

### Numbers & Specificity

- Always use specific numbers over vague claims
- "$30K/month" not "significant revenue"
- "35 workflows" not "many workflows"
- "67% reply rate" not "high reply rate"
- "in 7 days" not "quickly"

### Sentence Style

- Declarative sentences. No filler words.
- "This changes everything." not "I really think this could potentially change a lot of things."
- Start sentences with action verbs when possible
- Rhetorical questions sparingly (max 1 per post)

### Length

- LinkedIn: 150-300 words (long enough for value, short enough for attention)
- X/Twitter: Under 280 characters for single tweets; thread format for longer content

## The CTA Block (Engagement Engine)

Almost every viral post ends with a CTA designed to drive comments and shares. This is the engagement engine.

### The Standard Giveaway CTA

```
I'm giving this away for free.

All you have to do is:

1. Like this post
2. Comment "[KEYWORD]"
3. Connect with me (so I can send it)

And then I'll send you access.

P.S. Repost for priority access.
```

The keyword should be short, relevant, and uppercase. Examples from viral posts:
- "PASTE"
- "CREATIVE"
- "SKILLS"
- "SONNET"
- "AGENT"
- "WORKFLOWS"
- "SYSTEM"

### The Soft CTA (No Giveaway)

```
If you want to use [tool/approach] to [achieve result]:

1. Connect with me
2. Comment "[KEYWORD]"

And I'll send you the complete breakdown.
```

### The Authority CTA

```
This is the exact system I use for [result].

If you're [target audience] doing [activity]:

This is your shortcut.

1. Connect with me
2. Comment "[KEYWORD]"

I'll send you the full framework.
```

### CTA Rules

- Always include a comment keyword (this is the primary engagement driver)
- "Connect with me" enables DM delivery
- "Repost for priority access" adds viral spread as a P.S.
- Scarcity line optional: "I might not be able to get back to all comments, so if you want priority access..."
- Never put the CTA in the middle of the post. It's always the final block.

## Authority & Credibility Markers

Weave these naturally into the body (never the hook). They build trust without bragging.

### Types of Credibility

- **Spend/Revenue:** "I've managed $30M+ in Meta spend"
- **Client Results:** "I've helped 100+ agencies scale"
- **Specific Outcomes:** "This generated $30K in the last 7 days"
- **Tools Used:** "The stack: Relevance AI + Claude Sonnet 4.6"
- **Volume:** "I've tested this across 1,000+ campaigns"

### Placement

- After the hook, before the solution (establishes why they should listen)
- OR after the solution, as proof it works
- Never as the first line (comes across as bragging without context)

---

## Platform-Specific Adaptation

### LinkedIn

- Longer format (150-300 words)
- Professional but conversational tone
- Include an image/visual when possible (system diagrams, screenshots, branded graphics)
- Hashtags: 0-3 max, placed at very end or not at all
- Best for: Giveaway posts, system breakdowns, authority content

### X / Twitter

- Single tweet: Under 280 characters, punchy and self-contained
- Thread format: Hook tweet + 3-7 follow-up tweets for breakdowns
- More casual/raw tone allowed
- No hashtags in most cases (or 1-2 max)
- Best for: Quick takes, tool reactions, hot takes

### Adaptation Example

Same content, different platforms:

**LinkedIn version:**
```
RIP to basic Meta ad copy.

Claude OPUS 4.6 didn't just beat GPT for Meta ads. It destroyed it.

Most performance marketers think scaling is about:
More spend.
More creative.
More testing.

It's not.

Scaling is about iterative quality.

And that's where most people fail.

[... continues with system breakdown and CTA]
```

**X version:**
```
Claude Opus 4.6 just killed basic Meta ad copy.

Most marketers scale by spending more.

The winners scale by writing better — then replicating what works with AI.

I built a system that does this automatically. Thread
```

## Content Topics That Perform

Based on the analyzed viral posts, these topic categories consistently drive high engagement:

1. **AI Replacing Manual Work** - "RIP [manual process]" angle
2. **AI Workflow Systems** - "I built X workflows for Y" angle
3. **Tool Reactions** - "I tested [new AI tool] for [use case]" angle
4. **Agency Scaling** - "How I helped agencies do X" angle
5. **Outreach Automation** - AI-powered lead gen and outreach
6. **Ad Creative Automation** - AI for Meta/Google ad copy and strategy
7. **Free Resource Drops** - Giving away templates, workflows, systems
8. **Cost Replacement** - "I replaced $X/month in [service] with AI"

## SOP: Writing a Viral Post

### Step 1: Define the Core Message

```
Inputs:
- Topic / subject matter
- Target audience
- Key insight or value being shared
- Platform (LinkedIn or X)
- Desired CTA type (giveaway, soft, authority)
```

### Step 2: Select Hook Type

Choose from the 7 hook types based on content:
- Launching something new? -> Hook Type 2 (Builder) or 6 (Tool Drop)
- Sharing results? -> Hook Type 3 (Result) or 7 (Story)
- Giving away a resource? -> Hook Type 4 (Giveaway) or 5 (Value Comparison)
- Reacting to an AI tool? -> Hook Type 1 (Obituary) or 6 (Tool Drop)

Write 3 hook variations. Pick the most attention-grabbing one.

### Step 3: Build the Body

1. Pick a framework (Problem-Agitate-Solve, List Drop, or Story-to-System)
2. Write the body following the formatting rules:
   - One idea per line
   - Blank line between thoughts
   - Include specific numbers
   - Add bullet lists for the core value
3. Insert 1-2 credibility markers naturally

### Step 4: Craft the CTA

1. Choose CTA type based on post goal
2. Pick a relevant keyword (short, uppercase, memorable)
3. Write the CTA block
4. Add P.S. line for repost incentive if appropriate

### Step 5: Quality Check

Before finalizing, verify:
- [ ] Hook is one line and grabs attention immediately
- [ ] No paragraphs longer than 2 lines
- [ ] Blank line between every thought
- [ ] At least one bullet list or numbered list in the body
- [ ] Specific numbers used (not vague claims)
- [ ] CTA includes a comment keyword
- [ ] Total length: 150-300 words (LinkedIn) or under 280 chars (X single tweet)
- [ ] No filler words or unnecessary qualifiers
- [ ] Reads conversationally (not corporate or academic)
- [ ] Would YOU stop scrolling to read this?

## Prompt Template

```
Write a viral [LinkedIn/X] post about [TOPIC].

Target audience: [WHO]
Hook type: [Obituary / Builder / Result / Giveaway / Value Comparison / Tool Drop / Story]
Body framework: [Problem-Agitate-Solve / List Drop / Story-to-System]
CTA type: [Giveaway / Soft / Authority]
Comment keyword: [KEYWORD]

Key points to include:
- [Point 1]
- [Point 2]
- [Point 3]

Credibility markers:
- [Your relevant credential or result]

Tone: Confident, conversational, direct. No corporate speak. No filler.
```

---

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

- **No walls of text.** If it looks dense, it won't get read.
- **No vague claims.** "This is amazing" means nothing. Use numbers.
- **No corporate jargon.** "Synergize" and "leverage" are post killers.
- **No weak hooks.** "I've been thinking about..." is an instant scroll-past.
- **No long intros before value.** Get to the point in the first 2 lines.
- **No CTA without a comment keyword.** The keyword IS the engagement mechanism.
- **No humble-bragging.** State results directly or don't state them.
- **No emoji overload.** 0-5 per post maximum. They're accents, not content.
- **No hashtag spam.** 0-3 hashtags max on LinkedIn. Usually 0 on X.
- **No asking "Agree?" at the end.** This is the LinkedIn equivalent of a "subscribe and hit the bell" and people scroll past it.

## Visual Companion Guidelines

Most viral posts include an image. When suggesting visuals:

- **System diagrams** - Show workflow connections between tools (e.g., Claude + n8n + Meta Ads)
- **Screenshots** - Tool interfaces, results dashboards, before/after
- **Branded graphics** - Clean infographic showing the list/framework from the post
- **Tool logos** - Arrange relevant tool logos in a grid or flow diagram
- **Dark background preferred** - Higher contrast, more professional feel

## Metrics to Optimize For

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Comments | 50+ | Primary algorithm signal; comment keyword CTAs drive this |
| Reposts | 20+ | Extends reach beyond your network |
| Impressions | 10K+ | Indicates hook is working |
| Profile views | +10% per post | Shows authority building is working |
| Connection requests | 5+ per post | Shows CTA is converting |
| DM conversations | Varies | Shows resource delivery is working |
